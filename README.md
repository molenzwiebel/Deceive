# :tophat: Deceive
Pretend like you aren't actually feeding your ass off in League of Legends. **Deceive** allows you to mask your online status if you use the new League client.
Once started, Deceive will be a little icon in your notification tray that allows you to manage whether or not you appear as offline or mobile to your friends.  

# FAQ
**Where can I download Deceive?**  
Click the [Releases](https://github.com/molenzwiebel/Deceive/releases) tab at the top to download the latest version.

**Can I still invite people? Can they invite me?**  
Your friends list will work as normal, which means that you can invite everyone. Your friends will not be able to invite you, even if they enter your name manually.

**Can I talk in lobbies/champion select?**  
Yes, you can talk in lobbies just fine. Only your global "presence" is filtered.
